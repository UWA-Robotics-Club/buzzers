# This weeks session: 
For those able to make tonight's session from 4-(late)pm I plan to go through the following things:

1. 30min - 1 hour : Informal introduction / Ice breakers
    - Some dedicated time to better meet each other and learn what we are all interested in. I will be bringing some biscuits and tea so we can have a nice get-together, and as some motivation to come on time.

2. 30min - 1 hour : Quick GitHub lesson
    - Pulling project files from the main branch

3. 2 hours : [Introduction to Godot Game Engine - Brackey's tutorial](/Tutorials/1.%20Brackeys%20"How%20to%20make%20a%20Video%20Game"/README-Tutorial1.md)
    - I plan to go through this as a group as best I can

4. Remaining time: Forum session
    - A place were we can discuss the project, interesting ideas, and any questions or feedback
